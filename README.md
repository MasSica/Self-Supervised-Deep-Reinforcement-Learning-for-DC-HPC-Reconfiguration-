# Self-Supervised Reversibility- Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for DC/HPC Optical Network Reconfiguration (RA-DRL)

## Introduction

This work has been carried out at the University of California Davis for my master's thesis and it is the starting point for the paper "Experimental Assessment of Reversibility-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optical Data Center Network Reconfiguration" that is currently under review for the ONDM 2023 conference. This repository contains only the code associated with the offline training of both the DRL and RA-DRL agents since the code used to deploy the agent to the testbed cannot be shared. Hence here you will find the code for the routing module, traffic monitoring module and the agents.
